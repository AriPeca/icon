      <p> Brooklyn, New York — This August, New York City was gearing up to reopen in many senses. School was starting up again soon, and for many children, it was the first time they would return to in-person classes in over a year. Some people who had been able to work from home since the start of the pandemic, were also slowly returning to the offices they had once abandoned. With a sense of change in the air, I set out to understand what kinds of things New Yorkers were waiting to see in order to feel like the city was recovering from the pandemic. I expected some to tell me that they were waiting for higher vaccination rates, lower covid-positivity rates, or simply the disappearance of masks altogether. What I found out though was that many weren’t waiting for anything at all.
        <br>
        <br>
        Some people I spoke to were happy that they had a job again, after being out of work for months. Others, simply couldn’t think of something they wanted to see—they had been forced to adapt to a new way of life, and thinking back to a time before the pandemic felt unhelpful to current life. That’s how I came to speak with some hispanic priests in north Brooklyn who had adapted to a new form of preaching. Youtube and Facebook had opened up new avenues for how to reach people with their sermons, and they weren’t ready to let go of this new discovery.
        <br>
        <br>
        Below you’ll hear the story of 41 year old pastor, Anthony Torres. On August 18, he received me at the Spirit of Brotherhood Church in Williamsburg, in jeans and a blue button down short sleeve shirt, wearing a baseball hat and clear glasses. He felt a lot younger than his age and was eager to show me around. We had spoken on the phone earlier in the day and what intrigued me was something I kept hearing from priests: Virtual mass was something they might continue to do in the future. I was here to find out exactly why.

        <h3>Limited In-Person Seats</h3>
        <p>Pastor Anthony Torres started offering virtual mass during the pandemic. He says he will continue offering it in the future even though some people are now coming to mass in person. Before the pandemic hit, his church had the capacity to host 500 congregants in person. These days, it is only admitting half of that number, in order to keep the transmission of covid down. Tony says some people still don't feel comfortable returning to in person mass. Making mass accesible to all has thus has become a big factor for continuing virtual mass in the future.</p>

For months now, the church has had a presence on social media with over 1,700 Youtube subscribers as well as 1104 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sbcny/?hl=en ref">Instagram </a>followers.</p>

        <h3>Global Reach</h3>
        <p>Every Monday, Tony receives a YouTube analytics reports which details where his audience is connecting from. His masses have been watched around the globe, from Brazil to China.  In theory two relatives living in separate countries could tune in to the same mass.</p>

      <h3>On Demand Convenience</h3>
      <p> Tony notes that there is a sector of the public that wants to be able to access mass at whatever hour is convenient to them, on demand. “I see the future of convenience. If I can watch it later, I will,” Tony notes. The church's YouTube videos are available after the livestream, and are archived on the church’s channel so that they can be accessed at the viewer’s convenience.</p>
